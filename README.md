## 🧠 Engineering Identity

I build distributed ingestion systems that sustain multi-terabyte indexing workloads under unpredictable traffic — without sacrificing cost efficiency or availability.

Currently part of the indexing charter for **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AWS)**.

Core focus:
- Throughput-aware scaling
- Backpressure control
- Observability-first design
- Cost predictability at scale
- Vector search infrastructure for LLM workloads

---

## 🚀 Production Impact

### Amazon — OpenSearch Serverless

**Scalability & Resilience**
- Designed internal **Index Rollover API** powering ingestion auto-scaling
- Engineered resource backpressure → reduced availability drops by **90%**
- Led **5TB+ ingestion benchmarking initiative**

**Observability & Metrics**
- Built dashboards for vector search indices (LLM embeddings / recommendation workloads)
- Designed ingestion, shard recovery, flush & refresh telemetry systems

**Business Impact**
- Resolved 100+ high-severity customer escalations
- Onboarded major enterprise customer → **+$2M/month revenue**
- Mitigated cost anomaly → reduced customer billing by **$8.7M**

### Razorpay — Backend Engineer

- Built advanced tax payment backend → **₹6.4 Crore launch month revenue**
- SME for payout-links microservice
- Prevented ₹4 Crore financial inconsistency via state correction fix
