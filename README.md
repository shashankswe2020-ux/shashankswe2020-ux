## 🧠 Engineering Summary

I design and operate distributed ingestion systems that sustain multi-terabyte indexing workloads under unpredictable traffic while maintaining availability and cost efficiency.

Currently part of the indexing charter for **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AWS)** — building infrastructure powering vector search and large-scale search workloads.

I focus on:
- Throughput-aware scaling
- Backpressure & flow control
- Observability-first architecture
- Failure-mode resilience
- Cost predictability at scale

## 🚀 Production Ownership

### Amazon — OpenSearch Serverless

**Scalability & Control**
- Designed and implemented internal **Index Rollover API** enabling ingestion auto-scaling
- Built controlled backpressure mechanism → reduced availability drops by **90%**
- Led 5TB+ ingestion benchmarking to identify system bottlenecks

**Observability & Reliability**
- Designed telemetry for ingestion, shard recovery, flush & refresh metrics
- Built dashboards for vector search indices (LLM embedding workloads)
- Improved signal-to-noise ratio in operational alerts

**Business & Customer Impact**
- Resolved 100+ high-severity performance escalations
- Onboarded major enterprise customer → **+$2M/month revenue**
- Mitigated cost anomaly → **$8.7M reduction in customer billing**

### Razorpay — Backend Engineer

- Designed backend for high-throughput tax payment workflows → **₹6.4 Crore launch month revenue**
- Owned payout-links microservice as SME
- Fixed state inconsistency bug preventing **₹4 Crore financial exposure**

## 📌 Engineering Philosophy

Design for failure.  
Measure before optimizing.  
Scale deliberately — not accidentally.
