## 🧠 Engineering Identity

I build distributed ingestion and search infrastructure that scales to multi-terabyte workloads with strong cost efficiency and availability guarantees.

Currently focused on **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AWS)** — designing systems for high-throughput indexing and observability for vector search workloads.

**Core principles:**
- Measure before optimizing  
- Design for failure  
- Scale with intent  
- Cost-efficient systems engineering

---

## 🚀 Key Impact (Production)

### 🔹 Amazon OpenSearch Serverless

**Scalability & Resilience**
- Designed and implemented **Index Rollover API** powering ingestion auto-scaling
- Built controlled resource backpressure → reduced availability drops by **90%**
- Led performance benchmarking for 5TB+ ingestion workloads

**Observability & Metrics**
- Created dashboards and telemetry for vector indices (LLM embedding + recommendation)
- Standardized ingestion + recovery metrics for SLA monitoring

**Business Outcomes**
- Resolved 100+ high-impact customer escalations
- Onboarded a major enterprise customer → **+$2M/month revenue**
- Mitigated cost anomalies → **$8.7M reduction in customer billing**

### 🔹 Razorpay — Backend Engineer

- Built high-throughput tax payment backend → **₹6.4 Crore launch month**
- SME for payout-links service
- Fixed critical state inconsistency → prevented **₹4 Crore loss**
